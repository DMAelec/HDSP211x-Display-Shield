# HDSP 211x LED Display Shield
 An HDSP 211x LED display shield for the Arduino Uno R3. This display uses a HDSP led character display and a 74HC595
 8 bit shift register to reduce the amount of pins. The shield also has spots for 3 tactile buttons, extra indication
 LED's, and a DS3231 i2c RTC clock. One of the LED's can be substituted for a piezo buzzer.
 
 There are 4 different display choices to choose from.
